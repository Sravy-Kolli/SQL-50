- **Filtered Out:** ID 3 (description is `"boring"`)
- **Remaining:** Movies with ID 1 and 5
- **Sorted by Rating (desc):** 9.1, 8.9

## üîç Key Concepts Used

- `WHERE` clause for filtering odd IDs and excluding boring movies
- `MOD()` or `%` to check for odd-numbered IDs
- `ORDER BY` to sort by `rating DESC`
